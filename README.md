The website we have decided to test is comtrade.com . Comtrade.com is the home page of the Comtrade organization. You can find information about the organization and its companies as well as possible job openings.

We plan to test as many functionalities as possible, from visiting parts of the website to applying for a job. We will not be sending the application as to not clog up the websites database with dummy data.

We will use Intellij and/or Eclipse IDE and will be creating a Maven project to easily import all the needed dependencies.
